This project is aimed for PHP training sessions and is not designed to be used as a production code as-is.
It shows the basics to create a simple PHP extension.
It uses PHP >= 5.3, it's not designed to compile on PHP < 5.3 nor on Windows platforms.
Do not use it with threaded SAPIs as TSRM has not been implemented to keep code relatively simple.
